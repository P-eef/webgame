MIDNIGHT LODGING HOTEL

A project by Lika Tanaka, Marine Malisetyan, and JJ Moorhead

Audio, Design, and Story by Lika Tanaka
CSS, Sprites, and Imagery by Marine Malisetyan
JS by JJ Moorhead

Midnight Lodging Hotel is a sidescrolling game where the player must
solve puzzles before they are attacked by a restless spirit. If the
player fails to solve the puzzle in time they reach a game over, but
if they can manage to solve the puzzles before time runs out, they
can free the lost soul.

The project is organized into separate files for the HTML, CSS, and JS
with the JS in particular being split into files for handling the main
gameplay loop and minigame.

Running the project should be simple so long as all the files are present,
with the index.html being the head needed to execute everything.
